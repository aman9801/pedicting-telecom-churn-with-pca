# pedicting-telecom-churn-with-pca

### Problem Statement
With 21 predictor variables we need to predict whether a particular customer will switch to another telecom provider or not. In telecom terminology, this is referred to as churning and not churning, respectively.

### Analysis was done in Jupyter Notebook using these Python libraries - Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Statsmodels, Matplotib and Seaborn.

#### The steps are broadly:

- Importing and Merging Data
- Data Preparation
- Dummy Variable Creation
- Dropping the repeated variables
- Checking for Outliers
- Checking for Missing Values and Inputing Them
- Feature Standardisation
- Model Building
- Feature Selection Using RFE
- Making Predictions
- Model Evaluation
